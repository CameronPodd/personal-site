                            Welcome to my ENGL 210E portfolio, which serves as the culmination and critiquing of several technical communication documents
                            completed during the term. All work presented in this portfolio is my own, with my specific contributions
                            detailed at the beginning of each section. This portfolio is a single-page website, with each
                            section targeting a different chapter of the textbook. Documents are imbedded in the page as
                            images, with PDF and URL link attachments provided at the end of each section.

                Chapter 3 of Practical Strategies for Technical Communication places a large emphasis on setting up collaborative writing
                environments. From this section, learning how to maintain an accurate schedule and monitor the project were
                vital for the Orange Draft group’s success. As the facilitator, I created a timesheet template for the team
                to track the time spent working on the student handbook. By tracking progress with the timesheet, team members
                could plan ahead and allocate tasks in accordance to the progress of others.

            <p>
                Markel discusses the importance of creating a style sheet that “defines the characteristics of the document’s writing style”.
                With timesheets being an integral part of the handover packages, serving as a receipt for the hours worked,
                it was important that they were accurate and of the same quality as all other documents. To enforce a similar
                writing style, I introduced a Timesheet Guidelines directive document to supplement the timesheets – explaining
                all timesheet maintenance procedures.

            </ul>
            <p>
                The original version was created prior to covering the topic of directives and thus failed to include the elements required
                for an effective directive. Specifically, it did not present explanations for why the procedures were desirable
                or necessary, and failed to convey a modest and cooperative tone. The timesheet guideline directive was eventually
                rewritten to pose as a more compelling and persuasive document.

            <p>
                The Orange Draft team decided to administer a survey as the primary method of gathering information from our audience. The
                main objective of the survey was to collect the information required as simply and efficiently as possible.
                This was done using a variety of question strategies including scale, multiple choice, and short answer questions.
                It was important to gather enough useful information whist presenting a document that was short enough to
                complete in a reasonable amount of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed the survey to feature a total of 32 multiple choice and 9 short answer questions. The survey gathered data on
                the 4 main sections that the Orange Draft team was originally considering to include in the student handbook
                – food, university life, navigation, and the mathematics faculty.

                The Orange Draft group decided to use a web-based format for the student handbook to make it more easily accessible to students
                and incorporate augmented functionality. As the main web developer of
                <a href="https://uwhandbook.online/">uwhandbook.online</a>, I was responsible for designing and developing every aspect of the website, excluding
                the Student Life section.
            </p>
            <p>
                During development, I closely referenced and followed the 5 goals of document design from Practical Strategies for Technical
                Communication.

                                            Design principles and graphics are both utilised in the student handbook to help the readers understand the structure and
                                            hierarchy of the information. The principle of alignment was used to illustrate
                                            relationships and help organize information, whereas the principle of proximity
                                            was used to relate two items to one another. In the on-campus food section, alignment
                                            is what differentiates a restaurant chain from an individual store. In the Tim
                                            Hortons instructions, proximity is what connects the navigation steps to their
                                            corresponding images. By boxing and aligning content to the right of screen,
                                            proximity and alignment indicate that the information is relevant but not intended
                                            to be the main content of the page.

                                        To help the readers find the information they need, I took advantage of different design elements such as contrast, color
                                        and typography. Good contrast, sans serif typefaces, and large type sizes all make
                                        the content easy to read on different screens and in different environments. The
                                        orange accent color typically denotes interactable items and bold text typically
                                        signifies importance. Various different headings and rules are used to separate sections
                                        and subsections. The homepage index table groups information in different categories
                                        so that users can find the information they need quicker.

                                        Icon grids in the student services, student life, and food sections help the reader
                                        relate and correlate information to their memory. The off-campus food section utilises
                                        shades of green and red to identify how good or bad a metric score is. To help users
                                        better understand the information, items such as resource links and expandable checklists
                                        provide additional information and explanations about the content. Maps present spatial
                                        information to the user that is difficult to communicate with words, with legends
                                        helping the user interpret them.

                                        information boxes are used to create a sense of memorability for the website and
                                        its content. Repeating designs and patterns with external connotations like the paperback
                                        design also allows the user to associate the information to past memories and

                With busy schedules often interfering with one another, it was difficult for the Orange Draft group to meet in-person and
                communicate face-to-face. As a result, the majority of team-wide communication took place through the Slack
                group – where the team planned deliverables, set deadlines, allocated tasks, and relayed progress updates.

                In Slack, workspaces are comprised of multiple channels with different purposes and topics – allowing for different correspondence
                formalities to coexist in the same communication platform. For example, the #general channel was reserved
                for general work-related communication and often exhibited moderately formal correspondence. In contrast,
                the #random channel was reserved for non work-related communication and exhibited informal correspondence.

                                        were sent. Messages sent through direct messages or the #random channel typically
                                        featured informal language with slang, emojis, incomplete sentences, and abbreviations.
                                        Messages sent through the #general channel featured a moderately informal tone using
                                        complete and complex sentences with minimal abbreviations. Correct communication
                                        was only applicable to moderately formal correspondence, where communication was

                                        To project the “you” attitude, I conveyed a courteous and positive tone in all correspondence. I refrained from explicitly
                                        blaming others, and ensured that I always included a compliment when critiquing the
                                        work of others. I took into consideration and ensured that my correspondence met
                                        the interests and needs of all teammates. My communication in the #general channel
                                        was to the point, result driven and proactive.

                The feedback received after the original submission highlighted wordy and awkward language in the resumé rationale document,
                as well as a lack of textbook references. For this portfolio, the resumé rationale has been rewritten to
                incorporate the feedback provided.
