Having spent two summers at <b>InFlight Corporation</b> developing internal testing tools for enterprise systems, testing serves as my backbone and one of my earliest exposures to software development. At <b>InFlight Corporation</b>, I redesigned the UI of and added Google Chrome support to an internal demoing tool, as well as added new features to an internal Fiddler debugging extension. I also developed an automated client-side black-box web application testing framework, and conducted functional testing of HTTP requests, SSO, JSON objects, and web page elements.",web:"Need an experienced and enthusiastic web developer on your team? At the end of my freshman year of university, I worked at <b>CareGo Tek Inc.</b> doing full-stack web development and basic database administration for a web application. On the front-end, I added new pages, styled pages with both static and dynamic layouts, incorporated new interactive elements, created components for tables and forms, and improved mobile responsiveness. On the back-end, I optimized database queries, lowered the number of database calls, reduced web page load times, and improved the efficiency of frequently used data transformations and computations. In my spare time, when I’m not busy developing and maintaining this website, I like to practice my front-end web development skills and make contributions to the web development community through <b>CodePen</b>.",game:"Graphics and games have always been two of my greatest interests.
